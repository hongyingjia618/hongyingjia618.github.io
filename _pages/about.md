      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Ph.D. candidate in Design History and Theory at Tongji University, and currently a visiting researcher at UC Berkeley. My work explores how traditional Chinese crafts—such as lacework and hand-knotting—reflect the hidden stories of women, everyday life, and cultural memory.</p>
      <p>With a background in fashion design and brand management, I bridge the worlds of design practice, material culture, and narrative research. I enjoy working across disciplines and across cultures, and I believe in the power of design to carry meaning across time and place.</p>
