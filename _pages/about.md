        <p>
          Ph.D. candidate in Design History and Theory at Tongji University and
          currently a visiting researcher at UC Berkeley. My work explores how
          traditional Chinese crafts—such as lacework and hand‑knotting—reflect
          the hidden stories of women, everyday life, and cultural memory.

          With a background in fashion design and brand management, I bridge
          design practice, material culture, and narrative research. I enjoy
          working across disciplines and believe in the power of design to
          carry meaning across time and place.
